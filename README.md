## My config (vscode-neovim | iterm2 | aerospace)
- [nvim-config(Archive)](https://github.com/potatochick2020/nvim-config)
- I am using [vscode-neovim](https://github.com/vscode-neovim/vscode-neovim) now, iterm2 + vscode-neovim. Not really inclined to use the DAP debugger in Neovim, as I don't feel it aligns with the Vim philosophy of enhancing my workflow.
- I use [Aerosapce](https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace) as Tiling Window Manager on mac

## Currently learning
