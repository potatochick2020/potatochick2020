# My config (nvim + kitty + picom + gitui)
- [nvim-config(Archive)](https://github.com/potatochick2020/nvim-config)
- I am using vscode-neovim now, iterm2 + vscode-neovim. Not really inclined to use the DAP debugger in Neovim, as I don't feel it aligns with the Vim philosophy of enhancing my workflow.
- I use Aerosapce as Tiling Window Manager on mac, i3 on debian linux
